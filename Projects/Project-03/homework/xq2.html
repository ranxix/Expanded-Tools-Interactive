					<p class="three_show1">In the past 2-3 years, such a group of people has appeared on the waters of the Yangtze River. Some of them 
are volunteers from the protection association, while others are employed by the patrol team of the government. 
They all have the common task of combating illegal fishing in major lakes and the mainstream of the Yangtze 
River, observing and recording when and where the river dolphin may appear. Moreover, it is surprising that 
many of the people who “disturbed” the fishermen’s work are the “former fishermen.”.</p>
				<p class="three_show2">“Now all those fishing methods used by these people are what I have used. However then I found myself doing 
too much. Our three generations of grandparents and grandchildren all depended on the life of Dongting Lake. 
In the past few years, life has changed, and we have thought of returning to Dongting Lake. One must know how 
to be grateful and rewarded, so I organized a group of brothers who grew up in Dongting Lake. I said that it is 
difficult to survive in our generation of Dongting Lake. I hope my son can still see the fish in Dongting Lake.” 
Since he was 9 years old, He Daming has been fishing with his parents, and he knows everything about Dongting. He is now a volunteer at the Yueyang River Dolphin Guardian Association.</p>

				According to fishers, Dongting Lake used to be a ladle of water to drink directly. When sailing on Dongting Lake, 
you can see the dolphins jumping out of the water for breath from time to time, especially before the storm. The 
dolphins breathe with the lungs. Before the wind blows or the weather gets cold, the dolphins will rush out in the 
direction of the wind, commonly known as “River Piggy Worshipping the Wind.” When the fishermen saw that 
the finless porpoise began to "worship the wind," they had to hurry up and rush to the haven before the storm.
			</p>
			<p>For the fishermen, the river dolphin is a professional “weatherman” who can help them out of danger. Therefore, 
they have awe of the river dolphin and are afraid to catch them. For thousands of years, people have been with 
the river dolphin with peace and harmony. However, in recent years, the bodies of river dolphins have often 
appeared on the surface of the water or on the beaches, which are usually first discovered by fishermen. Those 
dead dolphins were cut into two by the propeller, and some were dissected and find their stomach was empty.</p>
			<p>The river dolphins found by the fishermen, even if they have no life, their mouth is slightly raised. This eternal, 
but lost smile, tearing the hearts of the fishermen.</p>
			<p>The Chinese NGO Alashan SEE Ecology Association launched the "The River Dolphin & Thousand People Program" in 2018. The plan tries to recruiting 1,000 fishers over the next 5-8 years and turn them into guardians of 
the river dolphins. The old "fishers" became "fish-protectors," and no one knows more about lakes or rivers than 
they do. They have a keen eye for illegal fishing gear hidden in the water and must observe on the river for a 
long time.</p>
		<p>Jiang Guoqing was one of the first professional fishermen to be "converted." For his sudden "transformation," 
the family and the villagers did not understand. The original annual income of 100,000 RMB was only 30,000 
RMB for a patrolman on the river. Jiang Guoqing does not regret the sudden drop in income. He said: "Although 
the income is small, it is not very important to me. For the sake of the long-term interests of the country, what is 
the sacrifice of this small family for the benefit of future generations?"</p>
		<p>Not only does Jiang think this way, but many “former fishermen” have a similar idea: for the sake of future generations. There may not be a particularly strong concept of protecting the environment in Chinese traditional 
culture, but almost everyone has an unparalleled "family concept." For their next generation, Chinese parents 
are often willing to do everything they can do.</p>
		<p>Fishermen's observation of the Yangtze River is very subtle. They will notice the change in water level and the 
trend of the fish. "The fish in the Yangtze River is now much less than in previous years, and there are many 
kinds of fish that have never appeared." Almost all fishermen have such feelings. "The size of the fish is now 
much smaller than before. It is hard to be as the same as before."</p>
		<p>Faced with the changes in the quantity and quality of fish, as well as the publicity from the government and 
NGOs, more and more fishermen have decided to transform themselves into other industries, or join the teams 
of volunteers like He Daming to "pay debts" for the Yangtze River.</p>
